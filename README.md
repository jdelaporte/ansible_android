# ansible_android
jdelaporte/ansible_android comes from a desire to make it take less time to switch to a new phone. Because I like upgrades? Nah. It's because I am really reliable about dropping my phone.


Intended steps:
1. Find steps on grapheneos site.
1. Charge phone.
1. Boot phone.
1. Update to latest Android.
1. Turn on settings needed to boot to installer.
1. Follow the grapheneos installer.
1. Make a list of all my apps (use sdk to query or backup from current phone?)
1. Install the apps to the new phone
1. Create Ansible to automate as many steps as possible
